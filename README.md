🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture
📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered web application that detects plant diseases using deep learning. It utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant diseases from images, helping farmers and agricultural researchers diagnose crop health efficiently. The system is implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

🚀 Features
✔️ Image-based Plant Disease Detection using deep learning
✔️ Web-based UI for easy interaction (built with Streamlit)
✔️ Supports multiple plant species and diseases
✔️ Fast and accurate predictions
✔️ Lightweight and scalable
